### **User Authentication and Management System Implementation**

#### **Issue 1: User Registration, Authentication, and Logout**

**User Stories**:

1. As a new user, I want to create an account on the TaskMaster platform so that I can start managing my tasks.
2. As a registered user, I want to log in securely to access my tasks.
3. As a user, I want to be able to log out securely when I'm done using the platform.

**Description**: This involves implementing the User Registration, Authentication, and Logout functionalities to establish a comprehensive user management system.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **User Registration API:**
   - [ ] Users can access the registration page from the login page.
   - [ ] Users must provide a valid email address, a unique username, and a strong password during registration.
   - [ ] Passwords are securely hashed before storage.
   - [ ] After successful registration, users receive a confirmation email with a verification link.
   - [ ] Users can click the verification link to activate their accounts.

2. **User Authentication API:**
   - [ ] Users can access the login page from the homepage.
   - [ ] Users must provide their registered email and password to log in.
   - [ ] Passwords are securely verified during the login process.
   - [ ] Successful login redirects users to their dashboard.

3. **User Logout Functionality:**
   - [ ] Users can log out from any page within the application.
   - [ ] After logout, users are redirected to the login page.
   - [ ] Users must log in again to access protected resources.

**Testing**:

- [ ] Test user registration with valid and invalid inputs.
- [ ] Verify that user data is stored securely.
- [ ] Confirm that verification emails are sent and accounts are activated upon clicking the link.
- [ ] Test user login with valid and invalid credentials.
- [ ] Verify that users are securely authenticated.
- [ ] Confirm that successful login redirects to the correct page.
- [ ] Test user logout functionality.
- [ ] Verify that users are redirected to the login page after logout.
- [ ] Confirm that users are required to log in again to access protected resources.

#### **Subtasks**:

1. [ ] Implement User Registration API
2. [ ] Implement User Authentication API
3. [ ] Create User Logout Functionality
