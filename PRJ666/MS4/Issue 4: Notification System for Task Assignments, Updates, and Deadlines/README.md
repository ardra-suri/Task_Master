### **Issue 4: Notification System for Task Assignments, Updates, and Deadlines**

**User Story**: As a team member, I want to receive timely notifications about task assignments, updates, and approaching deadlines to stay informed and manage my tasks effectively.

**Description**: Integrate a notification system into the Task Management Interface to alert users about important events such as new task assignments, task updates, and approaching deadlines. Notifications should be delivered in a timely manner and provide relevant information to help users stay organized.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Users should receive notifications when they are assigned a new task.
- [ ] Notifications for task assignments should include details about the assigned task, such as task name, description, and due date.
- [ ] Users should receive notifications when there are updates to tasks they are involved in.
- [ ] Task update notifications should clearly communicate the nature of the update (e.g., task status change, comments).
- [ ] Users should receive notifications as deadlines for their tasks approach.
- [ ] Deadline notifications should provide sufficient information about the task and the impending deadline.
- [ ] Users should have the option to customize their notification preferences, including the choice to receive notifications via email, in-app messages, or both.

**Testing**:

1. [ ] Assign a new task to a user and verify that the user receives a notification promptly.
2. [ ] Confirm that the notification for task assignments contains accurate information about the assigned task.
3. [ ] Make updates to a task that a user is involved in and verify that the user receives a notification reflecting the changes.
4. [ ] Ensure that the notification for task updates clearly communicates the nature of the update.
5. [ ] Set a deadline for a task and verify that the user receives a notification as the deadline approaches.
6. [ ] Confirm that the notification for approaching deadlines contains relevant details about the task and deadline.
7. [ ] Test the ability to customize notification preferences for different channels (email, in-app messages).
8. [ ] Verify that users receive notifications based on their chosen preferences.

#### Additional Considerations:

- [ ] Ensure that notifications are delivered in near real-time to keep users promptly informed.
- [ ] Design the Task Management Interface to display a visual indicator (e.g., notification icon) when users have unread notifications.
- [ ] Test the notification system on various devices (desktop, mobile) to ensure a consistent experience.
- [ ] Implement a fallback mechanism to handle situations where notifications cannot be delivered through one channel (e.g., email) to ensure users receive critical information.
- [ ] Ensure that the notification system is accessible to users with disabilities and complies with relevant accessibility standards.
