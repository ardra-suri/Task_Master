### **Issue 2: Unique Team Name Constraint - Resolution**

**User Story**: As a system administrator, I want to enforce the uniqueness of team names to prevent any potential confusion or overlap between teams.

**Description**: This issue addresses the need to implement a constraint that ensures all team names are unique within the system. This will contribute to a more organized and manageable team structure.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] System prevents the creation of a new team with a name that already exists.
- [ ] Existing teams with duplicate names are identified and appropriately handled.

**Testing**:

- [ ] Verify that creating a new team with an existing name is not allowed.
- [ ] Verify that existing teams with duplicate names are accurately identified.

#### Subtasks:

1. [ ] Implement unique team name constraint.
2. [ ] Develop handling mechanism for teams with duplicate names.

**Notes for Developers and Testers**:

The implementation of a unique team name constraint is essential for maintaining a well-organized system. Ensure that the system effectively prevents the creation of teams with duplicate names and appropriately handles existing teams with identical names during testing. The goal is to enhance the clarity and distinctiveness of team names within the system.
